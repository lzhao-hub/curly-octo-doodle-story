The King of Sea had a beautiful and kind daughter who named little mermaid. 
The little mermaid fell in love with the prince. 
The little mermaid endured great pain to take off the fish shape without hesitation, became human in order to pursue love. 
However, the prince, finally, married with an earthly woman. 
The witch told the little mermaid that if she killed the prince and made him bleed on her legs, she could go back to the sea and live a carefree life again. Nevertheless, he didn't.

Insted, she asked the witch to  make the prince fall in love with her.
The witch could do it, but she wouldnt do it for free.
If the little mermaid wanted the prince to love her, she would first have to kiss a frog.  

Thinking about it again and again, the mermaid first thought it was a ridiculous idea.
However, whenever the prince's face came up in her mind, she couldn't go to sleep at night.
Finally, at a full moon night, the little mermaid came to the castle to see the prince once again to make up her mind.
By the time she came out of the castle, there was just a frog there right in front of her.
The little mermaid held the frog up with both her hands, they looked into each others' eyes, then, the mermaid kissed the frog.
All of a sudden, the frog jumped off the mermaid's hand, and a strong light covered the frog's body---it became a man who looked just like the prince.
